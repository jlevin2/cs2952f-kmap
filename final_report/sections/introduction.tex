\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The development of the microservice and servicemesh has brought the sidecar container to the forefront of distributed services.
These sidecares provide shared features among services deployed on the servicemesh.
However, these sidecars are often interjected in a service-agnostic way by modifying iptables to redirect network communication through the sidecars.
This process can introduce significant latency to responses.
Istio has benchmarked Envoy to add between 5-10ms to response latencies on average for small to medium sized meshes (<=16 concurrent connections)~\cite{envoy_perf}.
We focus on the Envoy~\cite{envoy} sidecar used by the Istio~\cite{istio} servicemesh.

We present \sysname as an alternative library loaded via LD\_PRELOAD using shared memory to optimize data communication between processes.
Our work focuses on two key aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Building an efficient data path between Envoy and services
    \item Developing a robust API which mirrors classic POSIX sockets, which most common languages and tools use for interacting with the kernel stacks
\end{enumerate}

Our initial prototype explores challenges and design paths for the development of \sysname~\cite{kmap_source}.
We highlight challenges for implementing \sysname for production network systems.
Then, we present our prototype working on sample C/C++ webservers.
