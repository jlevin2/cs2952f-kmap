\section{Related Work}
\textbf{NetKernel:~\cite{netkernel}}
This work focuses on moving optimizing the network stack by moving it out of the kernel.
The impetus was in the VM-age, riping the kernel out of the VM itself provides more control and optimization for users.
Their improvements include shared memory.
In their work (Section 4.1) they discuss the use of LD\_PRELOAD for transport socket redirection.
For their usecase, LD\_PRELOAD was not robust enough and required too many mappings.
However, we see that for \sysname the transport socket redirection should be sufficient.


\textbf{Slim (OS):~\cite{slimos}}
SlimOS addresses performance challenges within the container network stack.
Similar to \sysname, they attempt to avoid traveling the virtualized network stack and directly preceding through the host network interface.
They work works at a lower abstraction level than \sysname but employs a similar principal.
SlimOS dynamically links its user-space library onto of containers using LD\_PRELOAD on unmodified application binaries.
