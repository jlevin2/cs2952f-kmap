\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present \sysname, an optimization library that intercept network syscalls to replace the kernel network stack with shared memory to allow for better performance. 
We use the so-called LD\_PRELOAD trick to intercept the library calls for both Envoy and local service.
Without network load, \sysname does not provide results with significant performance benefits; however, under some TCP load, \sysname managed to surpass the system performance.
