\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The development of the microservice and servicemesh has brought the sidecar container to the forefront of distributed services.
These sidecares provide shared features among services deployed on the servicemesh.
However, these sidecars are often interjected in a service-agnostic way by modifying iptables to redirect network communication through the sidecars.
This process can introduce significant latency to responses.
We focus on the Envoy~\cite{envoy} sidecar used by the Istio~\cite{istio} servicemesh.

We present \sysname as an alternative library loaded via LD\_PRELOAD using shared memory to optimize data communication between processes.
Our work focuses on two key aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Building an efficient data path between Envoy and services
    \item Developing a robust API which mirrors the original network stack
\end{enumerate}

Our initial prototype explores challenges and design paths in the development of \sysname.
