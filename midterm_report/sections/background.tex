\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
Recent shifts to microservice architectures and the resulting servicemesh have prioritized development and deployment efficency over performance.
Microservices deployed on a servicemesh (i.e. Istio~\cite{istio}) use proxies which are co-located with microservices.
These proxies intercept and control networking communication between services.
The proxies are relatively lightweight, but use the networking stack for communication with the co-located service (Figure-\ref{fig:no_kmap}).
They do this to preserve a common interface for services-- the networking stack.
Istio uses Envoy~\cite{envoy} which is the tool we focus on here for \sysname.
